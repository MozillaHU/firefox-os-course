# About the course structure (in English)

## Course description (as presented in [FFPlatform.pdf](FFPlatform.pdf))
> **Mobile application development on the Firefox OS platform*
>
> *„The Internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole. The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as a public resource.”* (https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/)
>
> However, leading mobile ecosystems weren't based on those principles, that's why Mozilla started its Boot2Gecko project in June 27, 2011. The project's goal was to create a new mobile platform based on open and standardized web technologies.
>
> The *Mobile application development on the Firefox OS platform* course introduces you to this new, modern and up-to-date platform. You can now develop applications for your mobile phone with a simple text editor by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
>
> During the semester, you will have a chance to learn how to access your phone's hardware, internal storage, even the network from this sleek mobile platform. You will familiarize yourself with using databases, notifications, activites. You will also get to know how to organize your application's functions and present them in an easy-to-use, pleasing user interface.
>
> The knowledge aquired during the semester won't just apply to Firefox OS though — you will be able to make use of most of what you have learnt in any other part of the web.

## Course structure:
* Streamed centrally via Hangouts &amp; recorded/shared immediately (catching up for next week if missed class is perfectly possible)
* Students could choose between a fully remote "e-learning" course and a course complemented by weekly laboratory classes (after the lectures). This extended course was way more successful in getting students successfully completing their application (and thus graduating).
* Laboratory course 2x45 minutes, hands-on exercises on the topic of the week's lecture
* On successful graduation, credit points are awarded to students at partner institutes (in Óbuda University, 3 credit points are awarded — 2 laboratory + 1 e-learning credit)
* Consultation opportunities with the lecturer + TeamViewer (remote help) avaiable
* After a first semester, local helpers ascend from previous semester's alumni students

## Current curriculum:
* 1, Intro (platform+html,css,js)
* 2, UI 1 (building blocks, components)
* 3, UI 2 (brick, appmaker)
* 4, Network comms 1 (Network, XMLHTTPRequest, CORS)
* 5, Network comms 2 (OAUTH, Persona/FB/G+)
* 6, Network comms 3 (websockets)
* 7, Storage 1 (local/sessionStorage, indexedDB)
* 8, Storage 2 (contacts)
* 9, Storage 3 (music/pictures/SDCard/video)
* 10, Sensors/API 1 (vibrate, battery, gyro/accelero)
* 11, Sensors/API 2 (geolocation, orientation)
* 12, Online APIs (writing location-based apps using OpenStreetMap)
* 13, Web Activities
* 14, Async/background (Alarm, Notifications APIs)
* (optional) 15, wrapup, presenting apps

## Prequisites:
**Teaching locations:**
* Internet access (to watch/download lectures & resources)
* Firefox OS hardware (to be able to test apps, APIs, etc.)

**Enrolled students:**
* Ideally at least *some* HTML+CSS+JS knowledge

## Output requirements:
Students are expected to have at least one Firefox OS application completed & uploaded for review at the Firefox Marketplace by the end of the semester. Successful review is not currently a requirement, due to technical limitations and incertainties in the review process. Students are graded based on the complexity and sophistication achieved in there application.
